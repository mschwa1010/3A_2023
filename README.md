Focuses on collecting, cleaning, and preparing the dataset.
- Notebooks:
  - `01_Data_Preparation.ipynb`
  - `01_Weather_Data.ipynb`
  - `01_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
Involves analyzing the spatial attributes of the dataset.
- Notebook: `02_Descriptive_Analysis.ipynb`

### Task 3: Cluster Analysis
Identifies patterns and groupings within the dataset.
- Notebook: `03_Cluster_Analysis.ipynb`

### Task 4: Predictive Analysis
Employs machine learning models, including SVMs and Neural Networks, to predict attributes.
- Notebook: `04_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb`

### Task 5: Smart Charging
Uses Reinforcement Learning to devise smart charging strategies.
- Notebook: `05_Smart_Charging.ipynb`

## Folders

- `images/`: This folder contains images that are used in the `02_Descriptive_Analysis.ipynb` Notebook.
- `data/`: Contains datasets that were small enough to be uploaded to GitHub.
